This is most of the work I've ever done in the fractal drawing program ContextFree
It uses a very simple language that was really accessible for me at the time I started around 2005.
You can get the open source app here: https://contextfreeart.org/

I hope you enjoy looking at these, and hope the code helps you to create your own!
